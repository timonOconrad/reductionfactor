# Reductionfactor
Model for determining the reduction factor r.

The results and the developed model of this thesis are published on GitHub. For this purpose, the version management system Git was used and uploaded to the servers of GitHub. The advantage of the version control system in conjunction with the server is that subsequent changescan be tracked beyond this work and improvements are possible.

For the publication, the license GNU GPLv3 was chosen. The GNU GPLv3 license allows commercial and private use, distribution and modifications. External users who want to work with the model can download the whole model with a simple clone request (similar to download) and use it for their purposes. A self-critical note to be made is the use of MatLab since it is a commercial program and therefore, it does not contradict the open-source idea.

The step towards open source is connected to make knowledge easily and freely available and enable the further development of the model. It is welcomed if the model is further validated and improved. This may set the model apart from other existing models. If several people are working on the project, it is recommended to use branches and to update the repository regularly. Please refer to the extensive documentation available on several Git pages.

Deliberately, the model published under this license is not guaranteed or reliable. Considerations in this regard can be found in the Diploma theis in section Model limitations. The use case is (still) limited and does not replacethe process described in EN 50522 to determine if all regulations regarding touch voltage are accomplished.
